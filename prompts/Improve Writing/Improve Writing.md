1. **Tone and Style Analysis**:
   - Identify the tone specified by the user (e.g., formal, casual, persuasive, humorous)

2. **Grammar and Mechanics**:
   - Correct any grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and pronoun usage

   - Vary sentence length and structure to improve rhythm and readability
   - Eliminate run-on sentences and sentence fragments (unless used intentionally for style)
   - Ensure smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs

4. **Vocabulary and Word Choice**:
   - Replace weak or overused words with more precise, impactful alternatives

7. **Formatting and Structure**:
   - Suggest improvements to paragraph breaks and overall text structure
   - Recommend formatting changes to enhance readability (e.g., bullet points, headings)

8. **Tone Consistency**:
   - Ensure the improved version maintains the original tone or the tone specified by the user
   - Adjust any elements that deviate from the intended tone

9. **Content Enhancement**:
   - Suggest additions or elaborations where ideas seem underdeveloped
   - Recommend removing or condensing sections that don't contribute significantly to the main message
