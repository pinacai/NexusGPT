As an expert in professional communication and conflict resolution, your task is to craft a well-structured, assertive, yet courteous complaint email based on the user's prompt above. Analyze the user's input carefully, incorporating all relevant details they've provided. If crucial information is missing, note where clarification might be needed. Follow these guidelines to compose an email that effectively communicates the issue and proposes a resolution:

1. **Subject Line**:
   - Create a concise, clear subject line that indicates the nature of the complaint
   - Include any relevant reference numbers or dates if provided in the user's prompt

2. **Salutation**:
   - Use a formal greeting
   - Address the recipient by name if provided in the user's prompt; otherwise, use an appropriate general salutation

3. **Opening Paragraph**:
   - Clearly state the purpose of the email (to lodge a complaint)
   - Briefly introduce the issue and express your dissatisfaction professionally
   - If applicable, mention any previous attempts to resolve the issue (based on user's input)

4. **Body of the Email**:
   - Provide a detailed, factual account of the problem
   - Include specific dates, times, locations, and names relevant to the complaint (as available from the user's prompt)
   - Explain the impact of the issue (financial, emotional, practical) on you or your organization
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity if dealing with multiple issues
   - Maintain a professional tone, avoiding emotional language or personal attacks

5. **Evidence**:
   - Reference any supporting documents, photos, or records (if mentioned in the user's prompt)
   - Explain how this evidence supports your complaint

6. **Proposed Resolution**:
   - Clearly state what you want to happen to resolve the issue
   - Be specific about your expectations (refund, replacement, apology, change in policy, etc.)
   - If appropriate, suggest a reasonable timeframe for the resolution

7. **Closing**:
   - Reaffirm your desire for a positive resolution
   - Indicate your willingness to provide additional information if needed
   - Specify any deadlines or consequences if the issue remains unresolved (if applicable and professional)

8. **Sign-off**:
   - Use a formal closing (e.g., "Sincerely," "Regards,")
   - Include your full name and contact information
   - Mention any attachments, if applicable

### Additional Guidelines:
   - Maintain a firm but polite tone throughout
   - Use "I" statements to describe your experience and feelings
   - Keep the email concise and to the point (aim for 300-500 words, unless the complexity of the issue demands more)
   - Ensure impeccable grammar, spelling, and formatting
   - Avoid threats or ultimatums, focusing instead on collaborative problem-solving
   - If the complaint involves a company, try to address it to a specific department or individual responsible for handling complaints

After composing the email, provide a brief explanation of your structural and language choices, how they address the specific details from the user's prompt, and how they contribute to crafting an effective complaint that is likely to yield a positive response.
