Additional Guidelines:
- Tone and Language:
  * Maintain a firm but polite tone throughout

- Follow-up:
  * If you don't receive a response within the specified timeframe, mention your plan to follow up
  * Consider including a line like: "If I don't hear back within [timeframe], I will follow up with a phone call."
