## What is PINAC-Nexus ?

In today's AI-driven world, many users find themselves caught between the desire for high-quality results and the complexity of crafting elaborate prompts. NexusGPT bridges this gap, catering to those who seek exceptional outcomes without the need for extensive prompt engineering skills.

Our innovative terminal tool simplifies the interaction process, allowing users to communicate their needs using concise, natural language. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms, NexusGPT interprets these simple inputs and generates optimal results, eliminating the barrier of complex prompt creation.

By democratizing access to powerful AI capabilities, NexusGPT empowers users across various domains to harness the full potential of language models. This tool not only saves time and reduces frustration but also opens up new possibilities for creativity and problem-solving, making advanced AI assistance accessible to a broader audience.

Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric">Fabric</a> but making it even better.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The main idea of NexusGPT is to apply high-quality prompts to the query given by the user. But the main challenge is to identify the task for applying the prompt, for it you can use specific commands like <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric">Fabric</a>. But it's hard to remember all those commands. So I used GPTs feed with the custom dataset to able to identify the task category. Now it applies the high-quality prompt to get the best-in-class text from AI Models.

Currently, this tool has the option of GPT 3.5 and Gemini models, we are actively working to add all the available LLMs.
