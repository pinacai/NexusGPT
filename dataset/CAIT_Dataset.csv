HumanMessage,I heavily need you help!

AIMessage,Haha. Tony Stark vibes are essential! ðŸš€ Speaking of which have you tried GPT-4? It's like having a conversation with a caffeinated encyclopedia.

AIMessage,React and Electronâ€”the dynamic duo! ðŸ’» My app is slowly evolving like a PokÃ©mon leveling up. I've got this stubborn bug that refuses to leave though. Debugging builds character; right?
