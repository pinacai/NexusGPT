HumanMessage,…INTRODUCTION…\n\nSoy milk is a high protein; iron-rich milky liquid produced from pressing ground; cooked soybeans. Creamy white soy milk resembles cow’s milk but in fact differs from its dairy counterpart in a number of ways. Not only it is higher in protein and iron content; but it is cholesterol-free; low fat; and low sodium. It is; however;lower in calcium and must be fortified with calcium when given to growing children. Those who are allergic to cow’s milk or are unable to digest lactose; the natural sugar found in cow’s milk; find soya milk easy to digest since it is lactose-free.Those who are calorie-conscious can purchase reduced fat soy milk(called lite soy milk) but this is often lower in protein as well. Somedo not enjoy the taste of original soy milk; so manufacturers nowoffer flavored soy milk. Soy milk can be substituted for milk innearly any recipe.Those who merely want to boost protein intake often add powderedsoy milk to other beverages; others find it economical to purchase itin powder form and then make soy milk when they add water to the powder. Children under one year of age should be given a formulaof soy milk specifically developed with their nutritional needs inmind.Soy milk requires only soybeans and water (and steam) for itscreation. Soy milk is nearly always fortified with calcium; vitaminsD; and certain B vitamins. Highly concentrated flavorings; such asvanilla; carob; chocolate; and almond are often added to the finished product.

HumanMessage,THEORY…\n\nNatural Milk is an opaque white fluid secreted by the mammary glandsof the female mammals. It contains proteins; carbohydrates; vitamins; minerals; fats and water. Fresh milk is sweet in taste. On keeping for a long time at 35-40 oC; it becomes sour due to lactic acid. That is why natural milk has a strong tendency to go bad in summers and is preserved at low temperature in refrigerators. In acidic conditions; casein of the milk starts separating out as a precipitate. When theacidity in milk is sufficient and the temperature is around 35oC; it forms a semi-solid mass called curd. The curd formation may be studiedby keeping the milk at different temperatures.Soybean milk is made from soybeans and resembles natural milk.Soybean is a plant whose beans serve as a food for animals and humanbeings. It is a rich source of proteins. It is used to prepare margarine; soya butter; cheese; curd and infant food. Soybean milk is prepared bykeeping soybeans dipped in water for sometimes. The swollen beans arethen crushed to a paste. The paste is mixed with water; solution is filtered and filtrate is soybean milk. It does not contain carbohydratesand lactose. It has no flavor. Soybean milk is solid after adding sugarand flavors.\n\nPROCEDURE…\n\n1) Soak about 150g of soya beans in sufficient amount of water sothat they are completely dipped in it.\n2)Take out swollen soya beans and grind them to a very fine paste and filter it through a muslin cloth.\n3)Clear white filtrate is soya bean milk. Compare its taste withbuffalo milk.\n4) Take 50 ml of soya bean milk in three other beakers and heatthe beakers to 30 oC; 40 oC and 50 oC respectively.\n5) Add ¼ spoonful curd to each of these beakers. Leave thebeakers undisturbed for 8 hours and curd is formed.

HumanMessage,Hey Pinac summarise it for me: Experiment with Attribute Combinations\nHopefully the previous sections gave you an idea of a few ways you can\nexplore the data and gain insights. You identified a few data quirks that you\nmay want to clean up before feeding the data to a machine learning\nalgorithm and you found interesting correlations between attributes in\nparticular with the target attribute. You also noticed that some attributes have\na skewed-right distribution so you may want to transform them (e.g. by\ncomputing their logarithm or square root). Of course your mileage will vary\nconsiderably with each project but the general ideas are similar.\nOne last thing you may want to do before preparing the data for machine\nlearning algorithms is to try out various attribute combinations. For example\nthe total number of rooms in a district is not very useful if you don’t know\nhow many households there are. What you really want is the number of\nrooms per household. Similarly the total number of bedrooms by itself is not\nvery useful: you probably want to compare it to the number of rooms. And\nthe population per household also seems like an interesting attribute\ncombination to look at. You create these new attributes as follows:\nhousing["rooms_per_house"] = housing["total_rooms"] / housing["households"]\nhousing["bedrooms_ratio"] = housing["total_bedrooms"] / housing["total_rooms"]\nhousing["people_per_house"] = housing["population"] / housing["households"]\nAnd then you look at the correlation matrix again:\n>>> corr_matrix = housing.corr()\n>>> corr_matrix["median_house_value"].sort_values(ascending=False)\nmedian_house_value 1.000000\nmedian_income\n0.688380\nrooms_per_house\n0.143663\ntotal_rooms\n0.137455\nhousing_median_age 0.102175\nhouseholds\n0.071426\ntotal_bedrooms\n0.054635\npopulation\n-0.020153\npeople_per_house -0.038224\nlongitude\n-0.050859latitude\n-0.139584\nbedrooms_ratio\n-0.256397\nName: median_house_value dtype: float64\nHey not bad! The new bedrooms_ratio attribute is much more correlated\nwith the median house value than the total number of rooms or bedrooms.\nApparently houses with a lower bedroom/room ratio tend to be more\nexpensive. The number of rooms per household is also more informative than\nthe total number of rooms in a district—obviously the larger the houses the\nmore expensive they are.\nThis round of exploration does not have to be absolutely thorough; the point\nis to start off on the right foot and quickly gain insights that will help you get\na first reasonably good prototype. But this is an iterative process: once you\nget a prototype up and running you can analyze its output to gain more\ninsights and come back to this exploration step.

You would write a detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you\nnoticed and your program would flag emails as spam if a number of\nthese patterns were detected.\n3.

HumanMessage,Explain it to me in very shot `EXAMPLES OF SAMPLING BIAS\nPerhaps the most famous example of sampling bias happened during the\nUS presidential election in 1936 which pitted Landon against Roosevelt:\nthe Literary Digest conducted a very large poll sending mail to about 10\nmillion people. It got 2.4 million answers and predicted with high\nconfidence that Landon would get 57% of the votes. Instead Roosevelt\nwon with 62% of the votes. The flaw was in the Literary Digest’s\nsampling method:\nFirst to obtain the addresses to send the polls to the Literary Digest\nused telephone directories lists of magazine subscribers club\nmembership lists and the like. All of these lists tended to favor\nwealthier people who were more likely to vote Republican (hence\nLandon).\nSecond less than 25% of the people who were polled answered.\nAgain this introduced a sampling bias by potentially ruling out\npeople who didn’t care much about politics people who didn’t like\nthe Literary Digest and other key groups. This is a special type of\nsampling bias called nonresponse bias.\nHere is another example: say you want to build a system to recognize\nfunk music videos. One way to build your training set is to search for\n“funk music” on YouTube and use the resulting videos. But this assumes\nthat YouTube’s search engine returns a set of videos that are\nrepresentative of all the funk music videos on YouTube. In reality the\nsearch results are likely to be biased toward popular artists (and if you\nlive in Brazil you will get a lot of “funk carioca” videos which sound\nnothing like James Brown). On the other hand how else can you get a\nlarge training set?`

HumanMessage,Explain it within 5 sentence: 'THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF DATA\nIn a famous paper published in 2001 Microsoft researchers Michele\nBanko and Eric Brill showed that very different machine learning\nalgorithms including fairly simple ones performed almost identically\nwell on a complex problem of natural language disambiguation 6 once\nthey were given enough data (as you can see in Figure 1-21).\nAs the authors put it “these results suggest that we may want to\nreconsider the trade-off between spending time and money on algorithm\ndevelopment versus spending it on corpus development”.\nThe idea that data matters more than algorithms for complex problems\nwas further popularized by Peter Norvig et al. in a paper titled “The\nUnreasonable Effectiveness of Data” published in 2009.⁠ 7 It should be\nnoted. however that small and medium-sized datasets are still very\ncommon and it is not always easy or cheap to get extra training data⁠ —\nso don’t abandon algorithms just yet.'
